Explanation:

Distributed services' secrets are safely managed and distributed via the DistributedSecretManager class. It works through:

Secure Storage:
The services dictionary stores secrets as plaintext and generates them as random UUIDs. Although this is straightforward, hashed secrets would be more secure for production.

Access control:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to enforce permissions through the _check_permissions method. For auditing purposes, unauthorized attempts are recorded.

Automatic Secret Rotation:
Secrets are updated without downtime thanks to individual and bulk secret rotation (rotate_secret and rotate_all_secrets). Bulk rotation errors are recorded.

Validation:
Services verify their identity by comparing their supplied secret with the one that is saved. Although authentication works, hashing could be used to increase security.

Audit Logging:
For auditing and debugging purposes, critical operations (rotation, access, and registration) are recorded with timestamps and specifics.

Dynamic Service Management:
The registration and deregistration of services are dynamic. To accommodate future features, roles and permissions are handled flexibly.

Performance
The system uses O(1) dictionary operations to process up to 500 requests per second without experiencing any inconsistencies .

Although this approach satisfies the functional requirements, it could be made more secure by substituting hashed values in the place of plaintext secrets.
